# Cloud Detection for Solar Plant Output Forecast

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea with the project is to create a software and intergarete it with the hardware too forecast energy production from a solar plant based on the clould and weather forecast. This enables a way to forecast the price of an electricity and to control crititcal applications and operations.

Using computer vision software the application will detect clouds and predict the shortage of the electricity for the current powerplant. The software is solely computer vison based application.

## Background
Electric energy produced from solar plant is varying with incoming radiation, which is based on the weather conditions. Thus such powerplants do not operate alone, but they co-exist with the more traditional powerplants.
Having a tool to predict energy production, makes it possible to predict and cut costs and to store an energy. 
This would benefit sustainability by lowing the external electric grid load.

## Data and AI techniques
The data needed to set up and train the tool are 
- camera input where a camera is pointing to the sky (cloud detection)

- historical data regarding local weather and power consumption

- weather forecast

## How is it used
The application is for large solar panel grids.

## What next

The real challenge for developers is to weigh the value of tasks based on their order, time of execution or environment in which they are carried out. If this were possible, a customer such as a powerplant would be needed.

## Acknowledgments
This is a work triggered by the course Building AI.
